# DevOps Engineer

## About Me
Hi, I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer with expertise in cloud computing, infrastructure automation, and CI/CD pipelines. With a proven track record of optimizing systems and reducing cloud costs by up to 30%, I thrive at the intersection of development and operations. My passion lies in solving complex problems creatively while building scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient solutions.

I have hands-on experience with tools like Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Helm, and Terraform, and I'm skilled in scripting with Python, Bash, and YAML. From automating workflows to enabling seamless deployments on platforms like EKS, my focus is on driving efficiency and improving system performance.

When I'm not architecting solutions, I explore innovative technologies to help organizations achieve their DevOps goals faster. I'm also passionate about knowledge-sharing, and my projects here reflect my journey in mastering and refining DevOps best practices.
